She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged \\nto home with hospice on ___.\\n\\n# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient \\npresented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed \\nwith tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis \\non ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin.

It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \\nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \\ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \\nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \\n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \\nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \\ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \\n\\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \\nbiweekly BMPs (script written).

The patient reports that he was at \\nthe ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped \\non the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of \\nconsciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and \\nappeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred \\nto ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of \\nthe head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and \\nseptal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral \\nRhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge \\nof his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. \\nWhile in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up \\nsome blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was \\nnoted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a \\nbrief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his \\nbaseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his \\nhead. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event \\nconfusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic \\nchanges.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient \\nwas transferred for further care.\\n\\nIn the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs \\nwere notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr \\n36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was \\nnegative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left \\nlung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing \\npneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate \\nfor antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and \\nmetoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.\\n \\nPast Medical History:\\nMI after AAA repair when he was ___ y/o\\nHTN\\nHypercholesterolemia\\n \\nSocial History:\\n___\\nFamily History:\\nPatient is unaware of a family history of bleeding diathesis.\\n\\n \\nPhysical Exam:\\nADMISSION:\\nVS: 98.5 142/65 95 18 98RA\\nGENERAL: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  \\nHEENT: Sclerae anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, bruising under \\nboth eyes, swollen nose with mild tenderness, RhinoRockets in \\nplace  \\nNECK: Supple, without LAD  \\nRESP: Generally CTA bilaterally  \\nCV: RRR, (+)S1/S2 no m/r/g  \\nABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended\\nGU: Deferred \\nEXT: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or \\nedema  \\nNEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, motor function grossly normal\\nSKIN: No excoriations or rash.\\n\\nDISCHARGE:\\nVS: 98.4 125/55 73 18 94RA\\nGENERAL: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  \\nHEENT: Sclerae anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, bruising under \\nboth eyes, swollen nose with mild tenderness, RhinoRockets in \\nplace  \\nNECK: Supple, without LAD  \\nRESP: Generally CTA bilaterally  \\nCV: RRR, (+)S1/S2 no m/r/g  \\nABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended\\nGU: Deferred \\nEXT: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or \\nedema  \\nNEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, motor function grossly normal\\nSKIN: No excoriations or rash.\\n \\nPertinent Results:\\nADMISSION:\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD WBC-11.3* RBC-4.30* Hgb-14.1 Hct-40.2 \\nMCV-93 MCH-32.8* MCHC-35.1* RDW-12.8 Plt ___\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD Neuts-91.1* Lymphs-4.7* Monos-3.8 Eos-0.3 \\nBaso-0.1\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD ___ PTT-26.8 ___\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD Glucose-159* UreaN-36* Creat-1.5* Na-141 \\nK-4.1 Cl-106 HCO3-21* AnGap-18\\n___ 06:03AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-594*\\n\\nCARDIAC MARKER TREND:\\n___ 07:45AM BLOOD cTropnT-0.04*\\n___ 06:03AM BLOOD CK-MB-36* MB Indx-6.1* cTropnT-0.57*\\n___ 03:03PM BLOOD CK-MB-23* MB Indx-4.2 cTropnT-0.89*\\n___ 05:59AM BLOOD CK-MB-8 cTropnT-1.28*\\n___ 01:16PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-1.29*\\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-1.48*\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-1.50*\\n\\nDISCHARGE LABS:\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD WBC-4.2 RBC-3.85* Hgb-12.5* Hct-36.0* \\nMCV-94 MCH-32.5* MCHC-34.7 RDW-12.9 Plt ___\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD Glucose-104* UreaN-30* Creat-1.6* Na-142 \\nK-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-26 AnGap-14\\n\\nIMAGING:\\n___ CXR\\nPA and lateral views of the chest provided. The lungs are \\nadequately \\naerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base \\nadjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular \\nengorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The \\ncardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch \\ncalcifications. The heart is top normal in size. \\n\\n___ ECHO\\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall \\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional \\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical \\nhypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 \\n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right \\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There \\nare three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve \\nstenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is \\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial \\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \\npressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic \\npericardial effusion. \\n\\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild \\nregional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD \\ndistribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic \\nregurgitation. \\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair \\ncomplicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who \\npresented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical \\nfall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.\\n\\n#Epistaxis, nasal fractures\\nPatient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets \\nplaced at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from \\nthat hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The \\nRhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued \\nprior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal \\nspray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. \\n\\n#NSTEMI\\nPatient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This \\nwas trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component \\ndowntrended during course of admission. The patient was without \\nchest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted \\nwho thought that this was most likely secondary to demand \\nischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram \\ndemonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based \\non wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was \\nuptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his \\nclopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.\\n\\n#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation\\nPatient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he \\nmaintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied \\nshortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious \\nsymptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation \\nin left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. \\n-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered \\nwith antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for \\nthe Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.\\n\\n#Acute kidney injury\\nPatient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at \\nPCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The \\npatient was discharged with a stable creatinine.\\n\\n#Peripheral vascular disease\\nPatient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of \\nMI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral \\nstents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease \\n(possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). \\n-Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR.\\n-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.\\n-Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL \\ninfiltrative process.\\n-Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later \\nevaluation of nasal fractures.\\n-Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and \\nplatelets.\\n-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for \\nease-of-administration.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged \\nto home with hospice on ___.\\n\\n# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient \\npresented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed \\nwith tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis \\non ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies \\non the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant \\nimprovement in her pain.\\n \\n# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that \\nshe had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. \\nAfter treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x \\n2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been \\npersistently elevated in the past and should continue to be \\nmonitored.\\n\\n# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 \\non admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n\\n# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic \\nhyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \\nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \\ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \\nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \\n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \\nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \\ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \\n\\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \\nbiweekly BMPs (script written).

You \\nwere admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely \\nthat this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from \\nyour cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid \\nwas removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to \\nhave a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came \\ndown with treatment but this should continue to be followed as \\nan outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a \\nrepresentative from hospice. Because of your repeated \\nparacenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex \\ncatheter placement.

For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by\\n0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He\\nsuccessfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but\\nbegan to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his\\nneurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. \\nDespite\\nthe changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted\\nprogressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.\\nThis has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the\\nbathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on\\n___ was reassuring. \\n\\nOn the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to\\nexperience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his\\nbackyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the\\ncouch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.\\nThe fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the\\npatient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24\\nhours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his\\nown. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who\\nrecommended presentation to the ED. \\n\\nIn the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and\\nSpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper\\nextremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a\\nnegative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no \\nEKG\\nchanges), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. \\nChest\\nXray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was\\nevaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for\\nfailure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,\\nand complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his\\nhome pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  \\n\\nOn arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He \\nis\\nnot accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is \\nin\\nthe hospital and that it is ___.

A CTA neck showed a thickened right \\nplatysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active \\ncontrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also \\ndeveloped a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain \\nfilms didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___ \\nHematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII \\nassay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his \\nhemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___. \\nRepeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The \\npatient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a \\nhemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the \\npatient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his \\nhemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank \\nhematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal \\nbleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally \\nintermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or \\npalpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of \\nthe week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___ \\nresting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course \\nof the week.  \\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. \\nInitial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was \\n9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was \\n103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage \\nalong the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary \\nread. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was \\ncontacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin \\n0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher \\nmanagement.  \\nPer review of records, the patient has a history of significant \\nbleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. \\nThroughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. \\nHe was tested and found to have ___ disease.

The patient reports that he was at \\nthe ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped \\non the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of \\nconsciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and \\nappeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred \\nto ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of \\nthe head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and \\nseptal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral \\nRhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge \\nof his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. \\nWhile in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up \\nsome blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was \\nnoted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a \\nbrief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his \\nbaseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his \\nhead. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event \\nconfusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic \\nchanges.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient \\nwas transferred for further care.\\n\\nIn the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs \\nwere notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr \\n36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was \\nnegative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left \\nlung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing \\npneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate \\nfor antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and \\nmetoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.\\n \\nPast Medical History:\\nMI after AAA repair when he was ___ y/o\\nHTN\\nHypercholesterolemia\\n \\nSocial History:\\n___\\nFamily History:\\nPatient is unaware of a family history of bleeding diathesis.\\n\\n \\nPhysical Exam:\\nADMISSION:\\nVS: 98.5 142/65 95 18 98RA\\nGENERAL: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  \\nHEENT: Sclerae anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, bruising under \\nboth eyes, swollen nose with mild tenderness, RhinoRockets in \\nplace  \\nNECK: Supple, without LAD  \\nRESP: Generally CTA bilaterally  \\nCV: RRR, (+)S1/S2 no m/r/g  \\nABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended\\nGU: Deferred \\nEXT: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or \\nedema  \\nNEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, motor function grossly normal\\nSKIN: No excoriations or rash.\\n\\nDISCHARGE:\\nVS: 98.4 125/55 73 18 94RA\\nGENERAL: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  \\nHEENT: Sclerae anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, bruising under \\nboth eyes, swollen nose with mild tenderness, RhinoRockets in \\nplace  \\nNECK: Supple, without LAD  \\nRESP: Generally CTA bilaterally  \\nCV: RRR, (+)S1/S2 no m/r/g  \\nABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended\\nGU: Deferred \\nEXT: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or \\nedema  \\nNEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, motor function grossly normal\\nSKIN: No excoriations or rash.\\n \\nPertinent Results:\\nADMISSION:\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD WBC-11.3* RBC-4.30* Hgb-14.1 Hct-40.2 \\nMCV-93 MCH-32.8* MCHC-35.1* RDW-12.8 Plt ___\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD Neuts-91.1* Lymphs-4.7* Monos-3.8 Eos-0.3 \\nBaso-0.1\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD ___ PTT-26.8 ___\\n___ 08:15PM BLOOD Glucose-159* UreaN-36* Creat-1.5* Na-141 \\nK-4.1 Cl-106 HCO3-21* AnGap-18\\n___ 06:03AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-594*\\n\\nCARDIAC MARKER TREND:\\n___ 07:45AM BLOOD cTropnT-0.04*\\n___ 06:03AM BLOOD CK-MB-36* MB Indx-6.1* cTropnT-0.57*\\n___ 03:03PM BLOOD CK-MB-23* MB Indx-4.2 cTropnT-0.89*\\n___ 05:59AM BLOOD CK-MB-8 cTropnT-1.28*\\n___ 01:16PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-1.29*\\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-1.48*\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-1.50*\\n\\nDISCHARGE LABS:\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD WBC-4.2 RBC-3.85* Hgb-12.5* Hct-36.0* \\nMCV-94 MCH-32.5* MCHC-34.7 RDW-12.9 Plt ___\\n___ 07:28AM BLOOD Glucose-104* UreaN-30* Creat-1.6* Na-142 \\nK-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-26 AnGap-14\\n\\nIMAGING:\\n___ CXR\\nPA and lateral views of the chest provided.

There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The \\ncardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch \\ncalcifications. The heart is top normal in size. \\n\\n___ ECHO\\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall \\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional \\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical \\nhypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 \\n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right \\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There \\nare three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve \\nstenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is \\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial \\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \\npressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic \\npericardial effusion. \\n\\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild \\nregional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD \\ndistribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic \\nregurgitation. \\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair \\ncomplicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who \\npresented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical \\nfall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.\\n\\n#Epistaxis, nasal fractures\\nPatient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets \\nplaced at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from \\nthat hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The \\nRhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued \\nprior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal \\nspray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. \\n\\n#NSTEMI\\nPatient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This \\nwas trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component \\ndowntrended during course of admission. The patient was without \\nchest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted \\nwho thought that this was most likely secondary to demand \\nischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram \\ndemonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based \\non wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was \\nuptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his \\nclopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.\\n\\n#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation\\nPatient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he \\nmaintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied \\nshortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious \\nsymptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation \\nin left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. \\n-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered \\nwith antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for \\nthe Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.\\n\\n#Acute kidney injury\\nPatient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at \\nPCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The \\npatient was discharged with a stable creatinine.\\n\\n#Peripheral vascular disease\\nPatient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of \\nMI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral \\nstents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease \\n(possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). \\n-Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR.\\n-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.\\n-Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL \\ninfiltrative process.\\n-Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later \\nevaluation of nasal fractures.\\n-Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and \\nplatelets.\\n-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for \\nease-of-administration.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.
